= 1.2.1 - 14-Nov-2008
* Fixed and updated callback handling.
* Fixed wide string return handling for pointers and strings.
* Added the Win32::API::Callback#address instance method.
* All errors are now in English instead of your native language, because
  that's what Ruby itself does.

= 1.2.0 - 22-Jul-2008
* Added support for the 'S' (string) prototype and return type. It can be
  used instead of 'P' (pointer) for const char*.
* Some internal refactoring. The attempts to load ANSI and/or Wide character
  versions of functions are skipped for MSVCRT functions, since they do not
  exist. This eliminates some unnecessary LoadLibrary() calls.
* Added a couple of gem building Rake tasks.
* Added a few more tests.

= 1.1.0 - 12-Jun-2008
* Added the Windows::API::Function class. This is a subclass of Win32::API
  meant only for use with raw function pointers.
* Some documentation updates in the source and README files.

= 1.0.6 - 18-Apr-2008
* Added the effective_function_name method. This allows you to see what the
  actual function name is that was defined, e.g. GetUserNameA vs GetUserNameW.
* Replaced an instance of _tcscmp with strcmp. The case in question was always
  going to be ASCII.
* Cleaned up some -W3 warnings.
* Added the build_manifest task to the Rakefile, which is automatically run if
  you're using a version of Ruby built with VC++ 8 or later. This builds a
  ruby.exe.manifest file (if it doesn't already exist).

= 1.0.5 - 20-Nov-2007
* The API.new method now defaults to "W" (wide character functions) before "A"
  (ANSI functions) if the $KCODE global variable is set to 'u' (UTF8).
* Minor improvements to the Rakefile.

= 1.0.4 - 26-Oct-2007
* Fixed a bug where methods that returned pointers ('P') could choke if the
  resulting pointer was 0 or NULL. In this case, nil is now returned instead.
* Tweak to the extconf.rb file that helps the gem build it from source
  properly.

= 1.0.3 - 28-Sep-2007
* Fixed a subtle but dangerous copy-on-write bug in the API#call method.

= 1.0.2 - 28-Sep-2007
* Fixed a bug in an internal struct member that was causing segfaults. Thanks
  go to Lars Olsson for the spot.
* Fixed the 'install' task in the Rakefile. This only affected native builds,
  not the prebuilt binary.
* Added a few more tests.

= 1.0.1 - 27-Sep-2007
* Functions declared with a void prototype no longer require an explicit nil
  argument to fulfill the arity requirement. You can still call them with an
  explicit nil if you wish, however.
* Fixed the gemspec for the native build.

= 1.0.0 - 14-Sep-2007
* Initial release
